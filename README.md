Welcome on board, fellow programmers! This is the specific repo dedicated to my YouTube channel only. I'm a software engineer, a guest lecturer at a university and I do enjoy crafting technical articles. I hope to help people from all walks of life to start their coding journey - especially front-end development, learn new technologies and inspire them to be happy & healthy developers both mentally and physically.

  ChatGPT doesn't have to be a threat. It can actually be a highly productive colleague.

FUN FACT => I studied Computer Programming & Information Technologies back in college, but I'm generally a big fan of self-learning. To learn something new in today's world, all we need to do is to be curious about that specific thing, do our research, concentrate on the process and finally get started with the first step. ðŸ˜‡
